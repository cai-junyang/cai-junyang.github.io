## Working Paper / My Latest Work

- **[Does expanding accessibility to naloxone actually reduce deaths?](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4921020)** (*Production and Operations Management*,  Major Revision)
   - <small><u>Abstract</u>: The widespread prevalence of opioids has compelled governments to introduce policies specifically targeted at reducing overdose-related deaths. Among the most direct measures is the expansion of access to naloxone, an opioid antagonist that effectively counteracts overdose-induced respiratory depression, thereby saving lives and enabling addicts to obtain it more readily. However, some critics argue that increasing naloxone accessibility may inadvertently contribute to a higher likelihood of opioid abuse. To gain a deeper understanding of the performance of this policy, this paper develops a simple mathematical model to analyze the impact of naloxone accessibility on the opioid crisis and the subsequent number of opioid-related deaths. Our analysis underscores that the effects of enhancing naloxone access are contingent upon various factors and are not uniformly advantageous. Notably, in certain scenarios, a modest improvement in accessibility, if not substantial, may paradoxically lead to an increase in overdose-related fatalities. Despite these complexities, we maintain that governments must remain steadfastly committed to enhancing naloxone accessibility, recognizing its pivotal role in reducing overdose-related deaths in specific instances. To be precise, governments confront a difficult dilemma: either strictly prohibit the use of naloxone or ensure its complete accessibility to all addicts, with the ultimate goal of minimizing deaths. Furthermore, our extended model considers the potential moral hazards associated with naloxone use, and our analysis indicates that this phenomenon does not invariably undermine the long-term management of the opioid epidemic.</small>

- **[When AI is not enough: Reducing diagnostic errors with radiologist oversight](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5037549)** (Under Review at *Service Science*)
   - <small><u>Abstract</u>: Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly prevalent, particularly in healthcare, where it is shaping the future of decision-making processes. In radiology, AI has revolutionized diagnostics by enabling rapid analysis of patient imaging. However, the consequences of AI misdiagnoses can be significant. For instance, an incorrect result may unnecessarily flag a healthy patient for treatment, while a missed detection might fail to identify a serious condition requiring immediate intervention. To mitigate such risks, most diagnostic systems combine AI analysis with radiologist review: AI first classifies cases, and radiologists then review and either confirm or modify the AI’s initial diagnosis. Effective scheduling for radiologists must account for the likelihood and cost of false negatives and false positives, as well as AI characteristics such as sensitivity and specificity.
To address the limitations of AI predictions, we develop a multi-server queuing model with separate queues for suspected-positive and suspected-negative cases. Using a fluid approximation, we derive an index-based policy—a modified version of the cµ/θ rule—to optimally schedule and allocate resources, accounting for AI characteristics and potential misclassifications. Our proposed policy naturally incorporates the anchoring effect, wherein radiologists may devote more time to misclassified cases, significantly influencing overall system performance. Furthermore, to prevent excessive waiting times, even for patients diagnosed as negative, we extend our model to incorporate diagnosis-based service level requirements established by hospitals and regulators. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our policy compared to a widely used benchmark, underscoring its potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.</small>

- **[A decision-making framework for supporting an equitable global vaccine distribution under humanitarian perspectives](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4289504)** (*European Journal of Operational Research*, Major Revision)
  - The Outstanding Paper Award of the 2024 Doctoral Student Forum of Antai School of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University
  - <small><u>Abstract</u>: This paper is motivated by the occurrence of vaccine nationalism in the setting of pandemics. Certain high-income countries (HICs) are aggressively accumulating vaccinations while showing little concern for the vaccination challenges faced by low- and middle-income countries. This disparity fosters the proliferation and mutation of viruses, thus risking the global population's health and welfare. Hence, we create a data-driven framework to tackle this humanitarian problem by facilitating the provision of vaccines. The framework comprises of two models: a network model named multi-strain Susceptible-Vaccinated-Infected-Removed-Susceptible and a vaccine distribution model with equitable constraints. The latter also encompasses the diverse uncertainty associated with vaccination hesitancy in different countries, in order to avoid potential wastage of resources. The vaccine distribution from our framework is based on greedy thought, thus enabling decision-makers to actively engage in the real-time vaccine allocation process. And we find that vaccine distributions generated by greedy thought almost reach the known hindsight optimal. When the suggested framework is applied to the scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic, the simulation results indicate that fair distributions could accelerate the conclusion of the pandemic. Additional scenarios, such as equitable levels, traveling intensity, and boosters, are also examined in the sensitivity analysis. The progression of the epidemic under vaccine nationalism is moreover simulated to highlight its harmfulness and validate the efficacy of our framework. We demonstrate that the inequitable advantage experienced by HICs is temporary, as HICs are bound to suffer from virus variants in due course when vaccinations become less efficacious against them.</small>
