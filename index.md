## Brief Introduction
My name is Junyang Cai, and I am currently a doctoral student in the Department of Data and Decision Sciences at the *Technion*. My advisor is Prof [Noa Zychlinski](https://noazy.net.technion.ac.il/). I obtained the Bachelor of Science degree from *Harbin University of Science and Technology* in 2021 and the Master of Management degree from *Shanghai University* in 2024. My research direction is operations management in healthcare.

   - <small><u>Abstract</u>: The widespread prevalence of opioids has compelled governments to introduce policies specifically targeted at reducing overdose-related deaths, with naloxone accessibility being one of the most prominent interventions. Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, is highly effective in reversing the effects of overdose, yet its expanded availability raises complex trade-offs, including concerns about moral hazard and increased opioid misuse. 
We develop a dynamic compartmental model to examine the effects of naloxone accessibility on the opioid epidemic, capturing transitions between susceptible individuals and those with opioid use disorder (OUD). Using this model, we analyze an optimization problem to determine the optimal naloxone accessibility level, balancing the reduction of overdose mortality against the potential increase in new OUD cases.
We find that full naloxone accessibility is optimal either when priority is given to minimizing new OUD cases and naloxone effectiveness is smaller than the moral hazard or when priority is given to minimizing overdose mortality and naloxone effectiveness exceeds the moral hazard. In the complementary cases, no naloxone accessibility is optimal.
When moral hazard is significant -- where increased naloxone accessibility may unintentionally encourage riskier opioid use among individuals with OUD -- expanding access can paradoxically result in higher overdose mortality, even as it reduces the incidence of new OUD cases. This underscores the profound impact of moral hazard on optimal naloxone accessibility policies, with the solution structure completely reversing under its influence. Policymakers must carefully navigate this dynamic to achieve a balance between accessibility and the associated risks.
Lastly, we offer two interaction-based extensions inspired by epidemiological models, which account for social dynamics between susceptible individuals and those with OUD. Despite the increased analytical complexity induced by these interactions, we identified common solution properties, such as a bang-bang structure and the reverse effect of moral hazard on the optimal solution structure.</small>
